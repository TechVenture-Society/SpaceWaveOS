## About

The SpaceWaveOS project produces a FREE,  is a general purpose operating system, based on the monolithic [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/) kernel. Its package system allows you to quickly install, update and remove software; software is provided in binary packages or can be built directly from sources with the help of the XBPS source packages collection.

It is available for a variety of platforms. Software packages can be built natively or cross compiled through the XBPS source packages collection.

Our efforts emphasize portability, standardization, correctness, proactive security and integrated cryptography.
The system is suitable for both beginners and professionals.


## Not a fork!

SpaceWave Linux is an independent distribution, developed entirely by volunteers.

Unlike trillions of other existing distros, SpaceWave is not a modification of an existing distribution. Build system have been written from scratch.
